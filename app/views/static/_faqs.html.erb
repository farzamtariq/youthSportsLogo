        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Yes.  This is one of the most powerful aspects of our Youth Sports Logo platform.  Build your brand while raising money to support your sports and team expenses.  NCAA regulations allow youth sports participants to raise up to 100% of the costs of their sports participation.  This includes lessons, equipment, uniforms, gas to tournaments/games, hotels, meals, gym memberships...even the cost of electricity and soap to wash uniforms!  You can also raise money for team expenses, team uniforms, team tournaments, team equipment, and more.  Once you order your Youth Sports Logo package you will get information on how you can immediately begin using your logo's to fundraise.  Here is one quick example; Katie played travel softball in Florida.  Her parents spent $2,000.00 a year on pitching lessons for Katie.  They wanted to recoup that money.  Katie used her Youth Sports Logo to have 50 challenge coins made featuring her logo.  Over the course of a few months Katie and her family sold all 50 of the challenge coins to friends, family members and supporters for $20.00 each.  They made a profit of close to $800.00, all of which was allowed to be used to help pay for Katie's pitching lessons.   Here is another quick example.  A girl's volleyball team was looking to raise money for an upcoming tournament that was out of state and that was going to cost $5,000.00 to attend with fees, hotels, food, gas, etc.  Each girl on the team had a Youth Sports Logo made for her.  Each girl then had their logo placed on a single Stanley insulated drinking cup.  Each girl then sold their one-of-a-kind  individualized Stanley drinking cup to a supporter or family member for $85.00, making a profit of $40.00 on each cup sold.  There were 22 girls on the team.  This single event raised $880.00 for the team to go towards their tournament fees.  We will provide many fundraising options for you to consider after you order your Youth Sports Logo package.</p>
